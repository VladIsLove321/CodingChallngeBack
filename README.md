This project lacks a lot of thing like CI/CD(eslint, husky, code coverage etc), logging, deployment, also it doesn't test a lot of scenarious and some corner cases.
But this is the most I could do in my spare time.

HOW TO RUN:
You have to have Postgresql locally with options from .env file
Clone this repo
npm i
npm run start
